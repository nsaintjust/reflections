When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository helps you collaborate with different people by having the repository online where multiple people 
can access at the same time. It adds security since your computer can crash and still access your work. 
You can also work on the same project from different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You don't want Git to stay automatically up-to-date with the remote repository because you might not necessarily want to see all the changes from the remote in your local. This would probably be the case if multiple people were working on the same branch.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks exist only in Github: they are used to copy a repository from another user and contribute to the project without
changing their initial work. This also helps credit them. We fork instead of : cloning then setting up a remote then pushing
the clone to the remote.
Forking then pulling as the remote is already set up.
Branches exists both locally and remotely. They are multiple versions of one repository.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
